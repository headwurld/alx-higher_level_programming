       ccuurrll  is  a  tool  for transferring data from or to a server. It supports these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS,
       LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET or TFTP. The command is designed to work without user  interac‐
       tion.

       curl  offers  a  busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authentication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file transfer resume and
       more. As you will see below, the number of features will make your head spin.

       curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See _l_i_b_c_u_r_l_(_3_) for details.

UURRLL
       The URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You find a detailed description in RFC 3986.

       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing part sets within braces and quoting the URL as in:

         "http://site.{one,two,three}.com"

       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

         "ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt"

         "ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt"    (with leading zeros)

         "ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt"

       Nested sequences are not supported, but you can use several ones next to each other:

         "http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html"

       You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They will be fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order. You can specify command line op‐
       tions and URLs mixed and in any order on the command line.

       You can specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number or letter:

         "http://example.com/file[1-100:10].txt"

         "http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt"

       When  using  []  or {} sequences when invoked from a command line prompt, you probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the shell from
       interfering with it. This also goes for other characters treated special, like for example '&', '?' and '*'.

       Provide the IPv6 zone index in the URL with an escaped percentage sign and the interface name. Like in

         "http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/"

       If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix, curl will attempt to guess what protocol you might want. It will then default to HTTP but try other protocols
       based on often-used host name prefixes. For example, for host names starting with "ftp." curl will assume you want to speak FTP.

       curl will do its best to use what you pass to it as a URL. It is not trying to validate it as a syntactically correct URL by any means but is fairly liberal
       with what it accepts.

       curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so that getting many files from the same server will not do multiple connects  /  hand‐
       shakes. This improves speed. Of course this is only done on files specified on a single command line and cannot be used between separate curl invocations.

OOUUTTPPUUTT
       If  not told otherwise, curl writes the received data to stdout. It can be instructed to instead save that data into a local file, using the _-_o_, _-_-_o_u_t_p_u_t or
       _-_O_, _-_-_r_e_m_o_t_e_-_n_a_m_e options. If curl is given multiple URLs to transfer on the command line, it similarly needs multiple options for where to save them.

       curl does not parse or otherwise "understand" the content it gets or writes as output. It does no encoding or decoding, unless explicitly asked to with ded‐
       icated command line options.
